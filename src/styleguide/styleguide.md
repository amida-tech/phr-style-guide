<h1 class="kss-title kss-title-main"> PHR Style Guide</h1>

This guide defines a set of standards for use in the creation of medically-themed web applications, particularly Personal Health Records (PHRs). 

This project uses the [KSS](https://github.com/kneath/kss) markup syntax on top of [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) to automatically generate the style guide, and is powered by [kss-node](https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node).  Both its content and template are based on [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) v3.2.0.

## Living Style Guide

This is a living style guide.  This means that this project is expected to continue to evolve over time as designs are refined and visualizations are enhanced.  Contributions are welcome; to contribute please open issues on [Github](https://github.com/amida-tech/phr-style-guide) or issue pull requests.
