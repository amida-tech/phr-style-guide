// Responsive Design.
//
// Supporting multiple device form factors is critical for the display of health records.  For instance, records are frequently viewed on mobile phones during encouters with medical providers.
// 
// To gracefully degrade, this style guide suggests the use of the responsive grid system in Twitter Bootstrap.
// This system uses media query break points to trigger degradation across devices of nearly any form factor.
// More information on the responsive grid system can be found at [getbootstrap.com](http://www.getbootstrap.com).
// 
// As a general rule, care must be taken to ensure there isn't a loss of information during transition between form factors.  Details about a record component, for example an allergy's reactions, if not immediately viewable following transition must still be accessible.  This means clear visual indicators for a user to access collapsed or hidden data.

// Note how by adjusting the browser window, the below blocks dynamically stack.

// Markup:
// <div class="col-md-12">
//   <div class="col-md-6"><button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-block">Block One</button></div>
//   <div class="col-md-6"><button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-block">Block Two</button></div>
// </div>

// Page Structure
//
// The primary navigation of the site should be statically fixed to the top and left side of the page. The navigation should feature a user picture and name, so at any time there can be certainty as to whose record is being viewed. 
//
// The navigation fixed to the top will be constant through all pages but the navigation on the left side is secondary and will vary based on the section. 
//
// There should be plenty of negative space to reduce confusion and better orient a user. In addition to the top and left-side navigation bars, each page will have a title and breadcrumbs to better orient the user.
//
// Data will generally be displayed in a timeline view -- a summary in form of a horizontal timeline at the top of main body of content, with the details below organized using paneled tables.
//
// Depending on the section and type of data, some pages might include data visualizations in the body of the page.

//

// Footer Usage
//
// The footer of the site can be modified further to include additional navigation links such as 'About Us', 'FAQ', and 'Contact Us'. Who and what these links point to depend on the context of the PHR. The basic footer attributes design and development to Amida, noting that the DRE is Open Source and licensed under Creative Commons. It is centered and placed at the foot of the browser.
