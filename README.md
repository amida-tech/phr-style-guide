# Personal Health Record Style Guide

###An open source style guide for Personal Health Records.

This project uses [KSS-Node](https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node) to automatically generate CSS documentation and the style guide.  KSS-Node is a Node.js implementation of [KSS](http://warpspire.com/kss/).

The style is written in Sassy CSS (SCSS).

To compile the documentation, you will need to install kss-node, and run the following command:

``
kss-node phr styleguide --sass phr/styles.scss
``
